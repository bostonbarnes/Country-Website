            <p>
                Of Iceland's 32 active volcanoes, none is watched more closely than Katla. <br>
                One of the nation's largest and most feared, Katla lies under glacial ice hundreds of meters thick. <br>
                Meaning that any eruption is likely to melt the ice and cause widespread flooding.
